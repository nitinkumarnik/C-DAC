Angular

1. Module
2. Component
	A place which groups html, css, client side javascript, event handling, all this logic come
	int component only.

3. Model
	We variable/parameters between service and components. Instead of passing them individually
	to function, we pass them as object to function. If we want to create an object we need 
	class. In angular we say these classes as Model.
	>> ng generate class someclassname

4. Service
	Business logic, like add of two numbers, multiplication etc. are written in service.
	Ajax calls done here.

	>> ng generate service somename
	>> -- two files created somename.service.ts and another for testing
	>> write business logic and return it
	>> in component.ts file import it
	>> import { classname } from './somename'; here somename is file name
	>> write it in constructore argument
	>> write in the event handling function

5. Directives and pipes
	Directives is term for two binding variable str in component html, like: [(ngModel)]='v2'.
	Pipes gives style to interpolation in html. {{ var | style }}


We pass information between component to service and get back information from service back to component.

Ajax call steps.
- generate model in which we can create objects to get data in single unit from the form.
- make form in html
- in component declare that object.
- in component > constructor init that object.
- make form and button
- generate model for result
- generate service 
- in service import the models, observable, httpclient
- in service > constructor pass argument like private ajx:HttpClient
- in service make function for ajaxcalltonode like:
	ajxcl(in:inputarg):Observable<OutModel> {
		let url = 'someurl';
		return this.ajx.post<OutModel>(url, in);
	}
- in component > constructor pass argument of service like privare sref:serviceName
- in component create fn to call service like:
	ajxservcl() {
		this.sref.ajxcal(this.object).subscribe(
			(data:OutModel) => {},
			(error) => {}
		);	
	}
